## Bio

I am a Data science undergraduate in the school of [Computer Science and Application](www.inspiria.edu.in) department at [MAKAUT](https://www.psu.edu/). My current work  focuses and reliability in multimodal foundation models.


By the way, take a look at [some things](/projects) I've built as a web developer, featuring [ohmycv.app](https://ohmycv.app) - a sleek, in-browser, privacy-first Markdown resume builder.
